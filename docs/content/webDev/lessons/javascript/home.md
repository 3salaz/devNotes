# Javascript

*Overview*

Javascript is my personal favoite language as it's the first language I understood when I first learned to code. We'll be diving into both front end and backend javascript concepts including node and deno js, and react and dom manipulation. Eventually mixing both to understand the concepts of both front end and backend responsibilities.
